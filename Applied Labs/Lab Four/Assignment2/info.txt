[BEFORE ANY Run]
Some Issues I ran Into::-

* 
Relative File Paths such 
            images = os.listdir('assignment data')
            path   = 'assignment data'
INSTEAD, what worked with me is
            images = os.listdir('Lab Four/Assignment2/assignment data')
            path   = 'Lab Four/Assignment2/assignment data' 

*
All Drawing Functionality I have troubles within because Missing qt5, and I tried hard to solve it but i FAIL,
so Please Fine Tune The Setting Required on YOUR DEVICE before Run, and consider the Logic I worked on.
